is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[Meson Build](https://mesonbuild.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64 and arm64)
and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

## Download

The binary files can be downloaded automatically with **xpm** or manually
from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

<Prerequisites/>

## Install

The full details of installing theÂ **xPack Meson Build**
on various platforms are presented in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack Meson Build generally follows the official
[Meson Build](https://mesonbuild.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

- Meson Build release
[{frontMatter.upstream_version}](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases/tag/{frontMatter.upstream_version}) from {frontMatter.upstream_release_date}.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream version, there are no functional changes.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- none

## Embedded Python

To simplify dependency management, this release embeds a **Python
{frontMatter.python_version}.{frontMatter.python_subversion}** instance.

The `meson` executable is a standard ELF/EXE which includes the Python
run-time; the `main()` function prepares the Python environment and then
invokes the Meson main:

```python
  PyRun_SimpleString("from mesonbuild import mesonmain\n");
  PyRun_SimpleString("sys.exit(mesonmain.main())\n");
```

The Python library is located in the standard location:

- <code>lib/python{frontMatter.python_version}</code>
- <code>lib/python{frontMatter.python_version}/lib-dynload</code> (the platform dependent files)

The Meson files are located in:

- <code>lib/python{frontMatter.python_version}/mesonbuild</code>

To speed up execution, all Python files are compiled and are
available only as `.pyc`.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available from:

- https://mesonbuild.com/Manual.html

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/builds/)
