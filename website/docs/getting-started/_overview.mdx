[Meson Build](https://mesonbuild.com) is an open source project hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson).

To simplify dependency management, the `meson` executable is a
standard ELF/EXE which includes the Python run-time; all Python
files are compiled and are available only as `.pyc`.
