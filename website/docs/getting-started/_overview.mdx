[Meson Build](https://mesonbuild.com) is a build system meant to be both fast
and user friendly.

**Meson Build** is an open source project hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson).

To simplify dependency management, in the xPack distribution,
the `meson` executable is a
standard ELF/EXE which includes the Python run-time; all Python
files are compiled and are available only as `.pyc`.
