## Release schedule

This distribution generally follows the official
[Meson Build releases](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases),
but generally it is one minor release behind the upstream releases.

In practical terms, based on past release schedule,
when the upstream {versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()+1}.1 is released,
the previous {versionMajor()}.{versionMinor()}.X
is probably no longer updated and can be released
(where X is the latest patch available).
