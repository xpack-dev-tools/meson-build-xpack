  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack Meson Build** on various platforms
are presented in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack Meson Build generally follows the official
[Meson Build](https://mesonbuild.org) releases.

The current version is based on:

- Meson Build release
[{frontMatter.upstream_version}](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases/tag/{frontMatter.upstream_version}) from {frontMatter.upstream_release_date}.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream version, there are no functional changes.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- none

## Embedded Python

To simplify dependency management, this release embeds a **Python
{frontMatter.python_version}.{frontMatter.python_subversion}** instance.

The `meson` executable is a standard ELF/EXE which includes the Python
run-time; the `main()` function prepares the Python environment and then
invokes the Meson main:

```python
  PyRun_SimpleString("from mesonbuild import mesonmain\n");
  PyRun_SimpleString("sys.exit(mesonmain.main())\n");
```

The Python library is located in the standard location:

- <code>lib/python{frontMatter.python_version}</code>
- <code>lib/python{frontMatter.python_version}/lib-dynload</code> (the platform dependent files)

The Meson files are located in:

- <code>lib/python{frontMatter.python_version}/mesonbuild</code>

To speed up execution, all Python files are compiled and are
available only as `.pyc`.

## Documentation

The original documentation is available from:

- https://mesonbuild.com/Manual.html

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/builds/)

## Deprecation notices

### Linux minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is **GLIBC 2.27**, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.
Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022.

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit Intel Linux and Intel Windows was
dropped in 2022.

### Pre-deprecation notice for 32-bit Arm Linux

Due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems,
support for 32-bit Arm Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a little while, but expect it to be dropped by 2025,
so it is recommended to consider an upgrade to a RPi 4 or 5 with
at least 4 GB (preferably 8 GB) of RAM.

## Pre-deprecation notice for Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS _Bionic Beaver_ reached the end of the standard five-year
maintenance window for Long-Term Support (LTS) release on 31 May 2023.

As a courtesy, the xPack GNU/Linux releases will continue to be based on
Ubuntu 18.04 for another year.

From 2025 onwards, the GNU/Linux binaries will be built on **Debian 10**,
(**GLIBC 2.28**), and are also expected to run on RedHat 8.

Users are urged to update their build and test infrastructure to
ensure a smooth transition to the next xPack releases.
