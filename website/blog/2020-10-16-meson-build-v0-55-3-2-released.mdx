The [xPack Meson Build](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/meson-build-xpack/)
is the **xPack** distribution of the
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) build system.

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86),
**macOS** (x64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64 and x86, arm64 and arm).

:::note Raspberry Pi

The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported).

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/meson-build@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack Meson Build** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The **xPack Meson Build** is based on the official
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) build system,
without any changes.

The current version is based on:

- Meson release
[0.55.3](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases/tag/0.55.3)
from Sep 11th, 2020.

## Bug fixes

- [[#1](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/issues/1)] - when
  installing meson as a project dependency, starting it fails on macOS, due
  to a bug preventing it to follow links; fixed;
- [[#2](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/issues/2)] - when
  generating commands in ninja.build that refer to itself, on GNU/Linux & macOS
  the path is not correct, it contains only a folder; fixed.

## Enhancements

- none

## Changes

Compared to the upstream version, there are no functional changes.

## Embedded Python

To simplify dependency management, this release embeds a Python
3.8.6 instance.

The `meson` executable is a standard ELF/EXE which includes the Python
run-time; the `main()` function prepares the Python environment and then
invokes the Meson main:

```python
  PyRun_SimpleString("from mesonbuild import mesonmain\n");
  PyRun_SimpleString("sys.exit(mesonmain.main())\n");
```

The Python library is located in the standard location:

- `lib/python3.8`
- `lib/python3.8/lib-dynload` (the platform dependent files)

The Meson files are located in:

- `lib/python3.8/mesonbuild`

To speed up execution, all Python files are compiled and are
available only as `.pyc`.

## Known problems

- none

## Documentation

The original documentation is available from:

- https://mesonbuild.com/Manual.html

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container (added in mid-2020)
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start on a wide range of
platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack Meson Build on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/builds/736462461)
- [test xPack Meson Build on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/meson-build-xpack/builds/736473428)

## Tests
